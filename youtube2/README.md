# YouTube2 plugin for Volumio

Credit goes to the [YouTube.js](https://github.com/LuanRT/YouTube.js) project. This plugin uses a [modified version](https://github.com/patrickkfkan/Volumio-YouTube.js) of that library for content fetching and YouTube login.

### Changelog

1.1.3
- Fix recursive loading of playlist items (when 'Load Full Playlist' enabled)
- Lazy-load Innertube API instead of loading when plugin starts, in case API causes system freeze or crash.
- Refactoring: endpoints, method signatures, etc.

1.1.2
- Fix broken auth (which causes Volumio to become unresponsive)

1.1.1
- Add 'YouTube Playback Mode' setting
- Minor UI fixes

1.1.0
- Migrate to TypeScript
- Add prefetch support
- Add option to fetch autoplay videos from Mixes and Related Videos in preference to using YouTube's default
- In plugin settings, warn user when Autoplay is enabled but Add to History isn't (this can lead to high number of repeating autoplay videos).

1.0.1
- Major update! Most things have changed:
  - Much simpler sign-in process - no Google API credentials required.
  - Contents mirror as closely as possible those of YouTube website. This means much wider content available.
  - You can now browse and play your saved playlists (not only created ones), private / unlisted playlists, videos, etc.
  - Live stream support.
  - Playback and autoplay follows YouTube's behavior.
