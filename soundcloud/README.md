# SoundCloud plugin for Volumio

Volumio plugin for browsing and playing SoundCloud content.

### Playback

The plugin uses [MPD](https://www.musicpd.org/) for playing a SoundCloud track, which can be in one or more of the following formats:

1. MPEG Audio (Progressive)
2. Ogg Opus (HLS)
3. MPEG Audio (HLS)

(These formats are revealed through inspecting the metadata of various SoundCloud tracks and may not be conclusive)

When playing a track, the plugin always looks for "MPEG Audio (Progressive)" first, then "Ogg Opus (HLS)". These two formats play just fine on Volumio 3.

The last format, "MPEG Audio (HLS)", is somewhat problematic. While the stream will still play, playback will terminate if you try to seek.

>It appears that tracks that do not have "MPEG Audio (Progressive)" formats do have "Ogg Opus (HLS)". The chance of encountering an "MPEG Audio (HLS)" format should in fact be quite small.

### Supporting SoundCloud and Artists

If you come across an album that you like, consider purchasing it to support the SoundCloud platform and its artists. The plugin displays links where applicable so you can follow them to the corresponding SoundCloud pages (note: links not available if Manifest UI is enabled).
