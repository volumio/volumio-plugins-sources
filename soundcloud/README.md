# SoundCloud plugin for Volumio

Volumio plugin for playing SoundCloud tracks.

This repository has two branches:

1. The `master` branch is targeted towards Volumio 3.
2. The `volumio-2.x` branch is targeted towards Volumio 2.x.

The focus is on the `master` branch. The `volumio-2.x` branch will only be maintained if it is practically feasible and still worthwhile to do so.

### Playback

The plugin uses [MPD](https://www.musicpd.org/) for playing a SoundCloud track, which can be in one or more of the following formats:

1. MPEG Audio (Progressive)
2. Ogg Opus (HLS)
3. MPEG Audio (HLS)

(These formats are revealed through inspecting the metadata of various SoundCloud tracks and may not be conclusive)

When playing a track, the plugin always looks for "MPEG Audio (Progressive)" first, then "Ogg Opus (HLS)". These two formats play just fine on Volumio 3.

The last format, "MPEG Audio (HLS)", is somewhat problematic. While the stream will still play, playback will terminate if you try to seek.

>It appears that tracks that do not have "MPEG Audio (Progressive)" formats do have "Ogg Opus (HLS)". The chance of encountering an "MPEG Audio (HLS)" format should in fact be quite small.

### Limitations

**Regionally restricted tracks**. There are two kinds of these tracks:
- Those that cannot be played at all are marked as "Unavailable in your region" and will be skipped as they are encountered.
- Those where playback is limited to the first 30 seconds are marked as "Preview" and the plugin will play these tracks for the trimmed duration. You can choose to skip these tracks in the plugin settings.

**Account login** is not supported as this requires applying to SoundCloud for an API key, and:
- SoundCloud is not accepting applications at the moment;
- Even if applications were considered, it is uncertain whether an API key would be granted;
- Even if an API key were granted, requests would be subject to a daily quota limit. This limit would be shared by *all* users of the plugin and could be exceeded fairly easily with a large enough number of users.

### Supporting SoundCloud and Artists

If you come across an album that you like, consider purchasing it to support the SoundCloud platform and its artists. The plugin displays links where applicable so you can follow them to the corresponding SoundCloud pages (note: links not available if Manifest UI is enabled).
